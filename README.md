# Helpful tips and commands for using the terminal

Note:-
1. For copying in terminal, use Ctrl+Shift+C. 
2. For pasting in terminal, use Ctrl+Shift+V.
3. Use Tab for auto completion wherever possible.
4. Use workspaces to increase productivity. Shift windows to different workspaces using Ctrl+Shift+Alt+arrow keys.
5. Switch between workspaces using Ctrl+Alt+arrow keys.
6. To enable workspaces, go to System settings>Appearance>Enable workspaces.
7. A period as the first character in the file name indicates that itâ€™s a hidden file. For example, **~/.tmux.conf** is a hidden file at the location **~**.
8. ~ refers to the path **/home/kulbir**
9. To check your working directory, use the command **pwd**. It will tell you the path of the current working directory.
10. You probably know this, but yes, I will write it. The shortcut to open the terminal is **Ctrl+Alt+T**. 

Using the copy command with Recursive search (-R for recursive and -i for interactive):-
Note:-
1. The path from where the file is **copied from** is written first.
2. The path where the file is **copied to** is written afterwards.
3. Use sudo to get permissions for copying
```
sudo cp -Ri Source_Folder Destination_Folder
sudo cp -Ri ~/Downloads/tmux.conf  /usr/share/doc/tmux/examples
```

For copying using GUI:-
```
gksu nautilus

```
